## 🔧 Config Additions

```yml
GlobalSettings:
  HealAlliesRadius: 10
  HealAlliesAmount: 35
  DoorEffectRadius: 15
  # Time delays are baked into effect logic (e.g. lock = 30s, unlock = 5s)

GoodEvents:
  CoinTheftChance: 6
  HealAlliesChance: 15
  DoorEffectChance: 12
  ScpSummonChance: 5
  # ... other chances remain

BadEvents:
  CoinTheftChance: 5
  RevealRoleChance: 10
  DnaSwapChance: 4
  # ... other chances remain
```

## ⚠️ Notes

* **Anti-Exploit:** Checks if players are alive, not SCP, and not spectators for swap logic.
* **Sound Failover:** If audio files are missing, plugin logs a warning.
* **Dependencies:**

  * `AudioPlayerApi.dll` must be referenced and properly loaded.

---

## 🛠️ Upcoming / Skipped

* `Flip Trap` and `Clone Yourself` were intentionally skipped.
* Additional effects may be added via config without core changes.

---

## 🔄 Legacy Core Logic Overview

* Weighted random effect logic using total chance sums.
* Uses `HintManager` for UI feedback.
* Uses `Timing.CallDelayed` to manage audio cleanup and delayed logic.
* Multiple fallbacks and no-crash paths for all critical logic.
* `EffectHandler.cs` orchestrates all result logic.

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

* Flip coin -> check audio
* Flip coin -> verify cooldown or max use
* Flip coin -> get Good/Bad outcome, validate hint/effect
* Flip coin -> check logs if debug enabled
* Audio -> confirm correct file used and destroyed
* All effects -> validate config weight controls probability
